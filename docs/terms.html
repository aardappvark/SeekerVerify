        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Seeker Verify</strong><br>
        <strong>Version 1.2.0 | Effective Date: February 13, 2026</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
        <p>By installing and using Seeker Verify ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>On-chain verification of Seeker Genesis Token (SGT) ownership</li>
            <li>Display of SKR token balance, staking, and reward information</li>
            <li>SOL balance and staked SOL display</li>
            <li>.skr domain resolution and display</li>
            <li>On-device Season 2 airdrop tier prediction based on on-chain activity</li>
            <li>Community fleet position and statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The App is a read-only tool. It does not create blockchain transactions, manage private keys, or hold custody of any assets.</p>

        <h2>3. Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A Solana Seeker device with an active Seeker Genesis Token (SGT)</li>
            <li>A Solana wallet app (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) installed on the device</li>
            <li>Internet connection for on-chain data queries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. No Financial Advice</h2>
        <p>The App displays on-chain data and generates predictions for informational purposes only. Nothing in this App constitutes financial advice, investment advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any cryptocurrency or token. The Season 2 Predictor is a speculative estimate based on observable on-chain activity and may not reflect actual future airdrop criteria. Do not make financial decisions based on information displayed in this App.</p>

        <h2>5. Accuracy of Data</h2>
        <p>The App reads data from the Solana blockchain via RPC endpoints. While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee that displayed data is always current or correct due to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RPC endpoint reliability and latency</li>
            <li>Blockchain network congestion</li>
            <li>Caching (data may be up to 24 hours old for some fields)</li>
            <li>Changes to on-chain program layouts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Always verify critical financial information through official sources such as Solscan or your wallet app.</p>

        <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. The App collects minimal data and stores everything locally. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for complete details.</p>
