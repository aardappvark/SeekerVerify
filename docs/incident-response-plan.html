        <h2>3. Response Procedures</h2>

        <!-- Procedure 1: Data Breach -->
        <div class="procedure-card">
            <h3>3.1 Data Breach Response</h3>
            <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Discovery that user data (wallet addresses, cached SGT data) has been or may have been accessed by an unauthorised party, through a vulnerability in the App, a compromised build, or other means.</p>

            <h4>Phase 1: Detection and Assessment (0-1 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Confirm the breach: Verify the report, reproduction steps, and scope</li>
                <li>Assess the data affected: Determine which data elements are exposed (wallet addresses, SGT cache, engagement data)</li>
                <li>Assess the number of users potentially affected</li>
                <li>Determine whether the vulnerability is in the App code, a dependency, or the Android platform</li>
                <li>Document all findings with timestamps</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 2: Containment (1-4 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If the vulnerability is in the App: Prepare a hotfix build immediately</li>
                <li>If the vulnerability is in a dependency: Assess whether the dependency can be updated or removed</li>
                <li>If a published build is compromised: Request emergency removal from Google Play Store</li>
                <li>If a signing key is compromised: Revoke and rotate the key (requires new app listing)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 3: Eradication and Recovery (4-48 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Develop, test, and publish a patched version of the App</li>
                <li>If applicable, issue a staged rollout to monitor for regressions</li>
                <li>Verify the fix resolves the vulnerability</li>
                <li>Update the App's changelog to describe the security fix (without disclosing exploit details)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 4: Notification (within 72 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Notify regulatory authorities as required (see Section 4)</li>
                <li>Notify affected users via Play Store update notes and GitHub advisory</li>
                <li>Publish a security advisory on the GitHub repository</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Contextual Note:</strong> Because Seeker Verify stores only wallet public addresses (which are already publicly visible on the Solana blockchain) and has no server infrastructure, the practical impact of a data breach is inherently limited. The wallet address cannot be used to access funds or control assets. However, all breaches will be treated seriously and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Procedure 2: RPC Endpoint Compromise -->
        <div class="procedure-card">
            <h3>3.2 RPC Endpoint Compromise</h3>
            <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> A third-party RPC endpoint (Solana public RPC, Helius) or price API (CoinGecko, Jupiter) is compromised, returning manipulated data, logging excessive user data, or exhibiting malicious behaviour.</p>

            <h4>Phase 1: Detection and Assessment (0-2 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Verify the compromise report: Cross-reference data from the suspected endpoint against known-good sources (e.g., Solscan, another RPC provider)</li>
                <li>Determine the type of compromise: Data manipulation, excessive logging, service injection, DNS hijack</li>
                <li>Assess user impact: Could users have made decisions based on incorrect data?</li>
                <li>Determine how many users may be affected (based on RPC provider selection)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 2: Containment (2-8 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If one RPC provider is compromised: Push an update that defaults to the alternative provider</li>
                <li>If a price API is compromised: Disable the affected price feed and display a warning to users</li>
                <li>Notify users via the App (if push update possible) or via GitHub/Play Store notes</li>
                <li>Contact the affected service provider to report the issue</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 3: Recovery (8-72 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Monitor the affected endpoint for resolution</li>
                <li>Re-enable the endpoint only after confirming the compromise is resolved</li>
                <li>If the provider is unreliable, evaluate alternative providers for future use</li>
                <li>Update the Privacy Policy if the third-party service list changes</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <!-- Procedure 3: Malicious Dependency -->
        <div class="procedure-card">
            <h3>3.3 Malicious Dependency</h3>
            <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> A dependency used by the App is found to contain malicious code, a critical vulnerability, or has been compromised via a supply chain attack.</p>

            <h4>Phase 1: Detection and Assessment (0-2 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the affected dependency and version</li>
                <li>Determine whether the affected version is included in the published App build</li>
                <li>Assess the potential impact: data exfiltration, code execution, privilege escalation</li>
                <li>Check security advisories (GitHub Security Advisories, NVD, OSV) for details</li>
                <li>Determine whether the App's usage of the dependency triggers the vulnerability</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 2: Containment (2-12 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If a patched version of the dependency exists: Update immediately and publish a new build</li>
                <li>If no patch is available: Assess whether the dependency can be temporarily removed or replaced</li>
                <li>If the vulnerability is critical and actively exploited: Request emergency App update via Play Store</li>
                <li>Pin a known-safe version of the dependency in the build configuration</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 3: Recovery (12-72 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Publish the patched App build to the Play Store</li>
                <li>Conduct a review of all other dependencies for similar issues</li>
                <li>Update dependency management practices if a process gap is identified</li>
                <li>Publish a GitHub security advisory if relevant</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <!-- Procedure 4: App Store Takedown -->
        <div class="procedure-card">
            <h3>3.4 App Store Takedown</h3>
            <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Google removes or suspends the Seeker Verify listing from the Play Store due to a policy violation, regulatory action, or other reason.</p>

            <h4>Phase 1: Assessment (0-4 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Review the Google Play Console notification to understand the specific policy violation or reason</li>
                <li>Determine whether the takedown is related to a security issue, content policy, or regulatory request</li>
                <li>Assess whether existing users are affected (existing installs typically continue to work)</li>
                <li>Document the takedown reason with screenshots and timestamps</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 2: Response (4-48 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If a policy violation: Make the required changes to bring the App into compliance</li>
                <li>If a regulatory request: Consult the relevant regulation and determine obligations</li>
                <li>If a false positive: Prepare and submit an appeal through the Google Play Console</li>
                <li>Submit the corrected build or appeal for review</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Phase 3: Communication (24-72 hours)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Notify users via the GitHub repository if the takedown is extended</li>
                <li>If applicable, provide an alternative distribution channel (direct APK from GitHub Releases)</li>
                <li>Update governance documents if the takedown reveals a compliance gap</li>

            <li><strong>Response assessment:</strong> Was the response timely and effective? Were there any delays or gaps?</li>
            <li><strong>Impact assessment:</strong> What was the actual impact on users, data, and the App's reputation?</li>
