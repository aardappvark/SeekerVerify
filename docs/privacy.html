        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Seeker Verify</strong><br>
        <strong>Version 1.2.0 | Effective Date: February 13, 2026</strong></p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Seeker Verify ("the App") is published by MidMightBit Games, based in Australia. The App is a companion tool for Solana Seeker device owners. It is built with privacy as a core principle. We collect minimal data, store everything locally on your device, and do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services. All blockchain data is read directly from the Solana network.</p>

        <h2>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h2>
        <p>Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR, the legal basis for processing your wallet public address is <strong>legitimate interest</strong> (Article 6(1)(f)) &mdash; specifically, the legitimate interest in providing SGT verification and on-chain data display that you voluntarily opt into by connecting your wallet. This processing is minimal, expected by the user, and proportionate.</p>
        <p>Under the Australian Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), the wallet public address is collected in accordance with APP 3 (collection of solicited personal information) for the primary purpose of on-chain identity verification and portfolio display.</p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Wallet Public Key (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Solana wallet public address is stored locally on your device</li>
            <li>Used to query the Solana blockchain for SGT ownership, SKR balance, staking info, and on-chain activity</li>
            <li>This is a public key, not a private key &mdash; it cannot be used to access your funds</li>
            <li>Stored using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256 encryption)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SGT Verification Data (Local Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Seeker Genesis Token member number and verification status</li>
            <li>Cached locally for 24 hours to minimize RPC calls</li>
            <li>Stored using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256 encryption)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Engagement Data (Local Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Daily check-in streak counter stored locally</li>
            <li>No data is shared externally</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User Preferences (Local Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>RPC provider preference (public or Helius)</li>
            <li>No personal information is stored in preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers</li>
            <li>Usage analytics</li>
            <li>Crash reports</li>
            <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
            <li>Browsing history</li>
            <li>Contact lists</li>
            <li>Any financial data beyond publicly visible on-chain balances</li>
            <li>Cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IP Address Disclosure</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect or store your IP address. However, when the App makes network requests to third-party RPC endpoints and APIs, <strong>your IP address is transmitted to those services</strong> as part of standard internet protocol. These services include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solana public RPC</strong> (api.mainnet-beta.solana.com) &mdash; operated by Solana Foundation</li>
            <li><strong>Helius RPC</strong> (mainnet.helius-rpc.com) &mdash; US-based provider, subject to their <a href="https://www.helius.dev/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>CoinGecko API</strong> (api.coingecko.com) &mdash; for SOL price data, subject to their <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Jupiter Price API</strong> (price.jup.ag) &mdash; for SKR price data, subject to their privacy policy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>MidMightBit Games has no access to any logs or data collected by these third-party services. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences with AES-256-GCM encryption (values) and AES-256-SIV encryption (keys), backed by the Android Keystore. No data is transmitted to any server owned by MidMightBit Games. The App communicates only with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solana RPC endpoints:</strong> Public Solana mainnet-beta or Helius free tier (your choice) to read on-chain data</li>
            <li><strong>CoinGecko API:</strong> To fetch SOL/USD price (no user data sent beyond IP address)</li>
            <li><strong>Jupiter Price API:</strong> To fetch SKR/USD price (no user data sent beyond IP address)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All network communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption in transit. The App enforces HTTPS for all connections and does not permit cleartext traffic.</p>

        <h2>On-Chain Data</h2>
        <p>The App reads publicly available data from the Solana blockchain including token balances, staking positions, transaction history, and token metadata. This data is inherently public on the Solana network. The App does not create any blockchain transactions.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your data is retained locally on your device for as long as the App is installed. Data is automatically deleted when you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disconnect your wallet within the App (Settings &gt; Disconnect Wallet)</li>
            <li>Use the "Delete All Data" button in Settings</li>
            <li>Clear the App's data through Android Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Seeker Verify &gt; Clear Data</li>
            <li>Uninstall the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>When making RPC calls, your wallet public address and IP address are transmitted to Solana RPC endpoints (including Helius, a US-based provider) to retrieve on-chain data. Your wallet public address is already publicly visible on the Solana blockchain. No user-specific data is sent to MidMightBit Games servers (we have none).</p>
        <p>We rely on the public nature of blockchain data and your explicit request to use this service as the basis for these transmissions. For EU/UK users, this processing is necessary for the performance of the service at your request (GDPR Article 49(1)(b)).</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party libraries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter:</strong> Used to connect to your Solana wallet app on-device. No data is sent to Solana Mobile.</li>
            <li><strong>seeker-verify library:</strong> Open-source library for SGT verification. Runs entirely on-device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The App does NOT include any:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analytics SDKs</li>
            <li>Advertising SDKs</li>
            <li>Crash reporting SDKs</li>
            <li>Social media SDKs</li>
            <li>Push notification services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>

        <h3>Right to Delete (Erasure)</h3>
        <p>You can delete all App data at any time by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tapping "Disconnect Wallet" in the App's Settings screen</li>
            <li>Using the "Delete All Data" button in Settings for complete erasure</li>
            <li>Going to Android Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Seeker Verify &gt; Clear Data</li>
            <li>Or uninstalling the App</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This satisfies the right to erasure under GDPR Article 17, UK GDPR, and the Australian Privacy Act.</p>

        <h3>Right to Access</h3>
        <p>All data stored by the App is visible within the App itself (Identity, Portfolio, and Settings screens). You may also contact us to request a summary of any data associated with your wallet address.</p>

        <h3>Right to Rectification (GDPR Article 16)</h3>
        <p>As all data is sourced from the public Solana blockchain, the App displays factual on-chain data. If you believe any cached data is inaccurate, you can force a refresh by disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet, which will re-fetch current on-chain data.</p>

        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing (GDPR Article 18)</h3>
        <p>You may restrict the processing of your wallet address at any time by disconnecting your wallet in the Settings screen. This stops all data processing and removes your wallet address from local storage. You may reconnect at any time to resume the service.</p>

        <h3>Right to Object</h3>
        <p>You may object to the processing of your wallet address at any time by disconnecting your wallet in the Settings screen, which removes your wallet address from local storage.</p>

        <h3>Right to Portability</h3>
        <p>As all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your data at all times. Your wallet public address is the only data element and is already in your possession.</p>

        <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
        <p>If you believe your data protection rights have been violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Australia:</strong> Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) &mdash; <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au">oaic.gov.au</a></li>
            <li><strong>EU/EEA:</strong> Your local Data Protection Authority</li>
            <li><strong>UK:</strong> Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) &mdash; <a href="https://ico.org.uk">ico.org.uk</a></li>
