        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Seeker Verify</strong><br>
        <strong>Version 1.0.0 | Effective Date: February 12, 2026</strong></p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Seeker Verify ("the App") is published by MidMightBit Games, based in Australia. The App is a companion tool for Solana Seeker device owners. It is built with privacy as a core principle. We collect minimal data, store everything locally on your device, and do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services. All blockchain data is read directly from the Solana network.</p>

        <h2>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h2>
        <p>Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR, the legal basis for processing your wallet public address is <strong>legitimate interest</strong> (Article 6(1)(f)) &mdash; specifically, the legitimate interest in providing SGT verification and on-chain data display that you voluntarily opt into by connecting your wallet. This processing is minimal, expected by the user, and proportionate.</p>
        <p>Under the Australian Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), the wallet public address is collected in accordance with APP 3 (collection of solicited personal information) for the primary purpose of on-chain identity verification and portfolio display.</p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Wallet Public Key (Required)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Solana wallet public address is stored locally on your device</li>
            <li>Used to query the Solana blockchain for SGT ownership, SKR balance, staking info, and on-chain activity</li>
            <li>This is a public key, not a private key &mdash; it cannot be used to access your funds</li>
            <li>Stored using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256 encryption)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SGT Verification Data (Local Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Seeker Genesis Token member number and verification status</li>
            <li>Cached locally for 24 hours to minimize RPC calls</li>
            <li>Stored using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256 encryption)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Engagement Data (Local Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Daily check-in streak counter stored locally</li>
            <li>No data is shared externally</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User Preferences (Local Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>RPC provider preference (public or Helius)</li>
            <li>No personal information is stored in preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers</li>
            <li>Usage analytics</li>
            <li>Crash reports</li>
            <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
            <li>Browsing history</li>
            <li>Contact lists</li>
            <li>Any financial data beyond publicly visible on-chain balances</li>
            <li>IP addresses</li>
            <li>Cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device using Android EncryptedSharedPreferences with AES-256-GCM encryption. No data is transmitted to any server owned by MidMightBit Games. The App communicates only with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solana RPC endpoints:</strong> Public Solana mainnet-beta or Helius free tier (your choice) to read on-chain data</li>
            <li><strong>CoinGecko API:</strong> To fetch SOL/USD price (no user data sent)</li>
            <li><strong>Jupiter Price API:</strong> To fetch SKR/USD price (no user data sent)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>On-Chain Data</h2>
        <p>The App reads publicly available data from the Solana blockchain including token balances, staking positions, transaction history, and token metadata. This data is inherently public on the Solana network. The App does not create any blockchain transactions.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your data is retained locally on your device for as long as the App is installed. Data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the App, disconnect your wallet within the App, or clear its data through Android settings.</p>

        <h2>Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>The App does not transfer any personal data across borders. RPC calls to Solana contain your public wallet address, which is already publicly visible on the blockchain. No user-specific data is sent to MidMightBit Games servers (we have none).</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party libraries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter:</strong> Used to connect to your Solana wallet app on-device. No data is sent to Solana Mobile.</li>
            <li><strong>seeker-verify library:</strong> Open-source library for SGT verification. Runs entirely on-device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The App does NOT include any:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analytics SDKs</li>
            <li>Advertising SDKs</li>
            <li>Crash reporting SDKs</li>
            <li>Social media SDKs</li>
            <li>Push notification services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>

        <h3>Right to Delete (Erasure)</h3>
        <p>You can delete all App data at any time by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tapping "Disconnect Wallet" in the App's Settings screen</li>
            <li>Going to Android Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Seeker Verify &gt; Clear Data</li>
            <li>Or uninstalling the App</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This satisfies the right to erasure under GDPR Article 17, UK GDPR, and the Australian Privacy Act.</p>

        <h3>Right to Access</h3>
        <p>All data stored by the App is visible within the App itself (Identity, Portfolio, and Settings screens). You may also contact us to request a summary of any data associated with your wallet address.</p>

        <h3>Right to Object</h3>
        <p>You may object to the processing of your wallet address at any time by disconnecting your wallet in the Settings screen, which removes your wallet address from local storage.</p>

        <h3>Right to Portability</h3>
        <p>As all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your data at all times.</p>

        <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
        <p>If you believe your data protection rights have been violated, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Australia:</strong> Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) &mdash; oaic.gov.au</li>
            <li><strong>EU/EEA:</strong> Your local Data Protection Authority</li>
            <li><strong>UK:</strong> Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) &mdash; ico.org.uk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is intended for users 18 years and older who own a Solana Seeker device. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 18.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the version number and effective date above.</p>
